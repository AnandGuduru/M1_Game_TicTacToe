## INTRODUCTION

Tic-Tac-Toe game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which one player draws X's and another player draws O's inside a set of nine squares and each player tries to be the first to fill a row, column, or diagonal of squares with either X's or O's. At the end of each turn the computer will check to see if X's have won the game or if the O's have won the game.

## OBJECTIVE

## Research

Started as a pen and paper game in Roman Empire in 1558, earlier it was called tic tac.
In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games.
After Digitalisation, this game is almost free for everyone on multiple mediums.
It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
